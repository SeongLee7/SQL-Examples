SQL-Examples
Overview
Welcome to the SQL-Examples repository! This repository showcases a variety of SQL scripts designed to demonstrate my knowledge of SQL in areas like data retrieval, data manipulation, creating views, stored procedures, functions, and more. The examples cover real-world scenarios such as managing invoices, vendors, boats, and trips.
